# Guide to Managing NIAC Events
## Introduction
This document aims provide some guidance to new executive officers of the NIAC. 
Anything discussed here is merely a suggestion and the only rules to be followed are written in the [constitution](https://www.nexusformat.org/NIAC.html).

## Teleconference
1. Choose a date
   * Hopefully had some agreement on a general timeframe (e.g. start, middle or end of next month) at the end of the previous meeting.
   * Make an online poll (using e.g. [Strawpoll](https://strawpoll.com/)) so that people can vote on their preferred dates.
   * Send an email to the nexus-committee and nexus-tech lists advertising the poll and give a deadline for voting.
   * Add a link to the poll in the minutes of the previous meeting.
   * After the deadline, select a specific date. This must be emailed to the nexus-committee and nexus-tech lists and it is good to include a link to the agenda page (see below) and attach a calendar item (see below).
2. Create Zoom Meeting
   * Log in to your Zoom account
   * Create a new meeting:
      * Be very careful about the time zone - use UTC!
      * Make the security settings very low, we haven't yet had any problem with unwanted people crashing the meeting, but you should try to make it possible for the meeting to still happen if you don't show up to host it.
         * (yes) Passcode
         * (no) Waiting room
         * (no) Require authentication to join
         * (yes) Allow participants to join anytime (this is hidden under "options")
      * Just "Computer audio" is enough, no need to include telephone audio.
4. Add agenda page to the wiki
