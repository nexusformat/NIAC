NeXus Community

..  verbatim from the Introduction

NeXus began as a group of scientists with the goal of defining a
common data storage format to exchange experimental results
and to exchange ideas about how to analyze them.

The :index:`NeXus Scientific Community <community>`
provides the scientific data, advice, and continued involvement
with the NeXus standard. NeXus provides a forum for the scientific
community to exchange ideas in data storage through the NeXus wiki.

The NeXus International Advisory Committee (:index:`NIAC`) supervises the
development and maintenance of the NeXus common data
format for neutron, X-ray, and muon science.
The NIAC supervises a technical committee to oversee the
NeXus Application Programmer Interface (NAPI) and the
NeXus class definitions.

There are several mechanisms in place in order to coordinate the 
development of NeXus with the larger community.

NeXus Wiki
============

First of all, there is the NeXus wiki,
http://wiki.nexusformat.org/,
which provides all kinds of information, including membership, minutes, and 
discussions from the meetings of the NIAC and Technical Committee
Code Camps, proposed designs for consideration by NeXus, the NeXus logo,
as well as some
legacy documentation that we have not quite managed to move into the manual.

Contributed Definitions
========================

The community is encouraged to provide new definitions 
(:ref:`base.class.definitions` or :ref:`application.definitions`) for consideration
in the NeXus standard.  These community contributions
will be entered in the :ref:`contributed.definitions` 
and will be curated according to procedures set forth by the :ref:`NIAC`.
