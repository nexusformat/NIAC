Strategies for storing information in NeXus data files
======================================================

NeXus may appear daunting, at first, to use.  The number of base classes
is quite large as well as is the number of application definitions.  This chapter
describes some of the strategies that have been recommended for
:index:`how to store <strategies>` information in NeXus data files.

When we use the term *storing*, some might be helped if they consider
this as descriptions for how to *classify* their data.

It is intended for this chapter to grow, with the addition of different use cases
as they are presented for suggestions.

Strategies: The simplest case(s)
################################

Perhaps the :index:`simplest case <strategies; simplest case(s)>`
might be either a step scan with two or more
columns of data.  Another simple case might be a single image acquired
by an area detector.  In either of these hypothetical
cases, the situation is so simple
that there is little addition information available to be described
(for whatever reason).

Step scan with two or more data columns
=======================================

Consider the case where we wish to store the data from a step scan.
This case may involve two or more *related*
1-D arrays of data to be saved, each
having the same length. For our hypothetical case, we'lll
have these positioners as arrays:

======================   ====================================================
positioner arrays        detector arrays
======================   ====================================================
``ar``, ``ay``, ``dy``   ``I0``, ``I00``, ``time``, ``Epoch``, ``photodiode``
======================   ====================================================

..  TODO ideas for more cases:
    simple instrument, no application definition
    simple instrument, with application definition
    instrument with multiple detectors, no application definition
    instrument with multiple detectors, with application definition
    instrument with multiple, simultaneous application definitions
    instrument with rapidly changing needs

Strategies: The wavelength
##########################

*Where should the wavelength of my experiment be written?*
This is one of the :ref:`FAQ`.
The canonical location to store wavelength has been::

	/NXentry/NXinstrument/NXcrystal/wavelength

More recently, this location makes more sense to many::

	/NXentry/NXinstrument/NXmonochromator/wavelength

:ref:`NXcrystal` describes a crystal monochromator or analyzer.
Recently, scientists with monochromatic radiation not defined by a crystal,
such as from an electron-beam undulator or a neutron helical velocity
selector, were not satisfied with creating a fictitious instance of a
crystal just to preserve the wavelength from their instrument.
Thus, the addition of the :ref:`NXmonochromator` base class to NeXus, 
which also allows "energy" to be specified if one is so inclined.

.. note:: See the :ref:`preface.Class.path.specification` section 
	for a short discussion of the difference between the HDF5 path 
	and the NeXus symbolic class path.
