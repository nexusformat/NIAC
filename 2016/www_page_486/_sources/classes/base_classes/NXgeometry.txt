NXgeometry

**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`, version 1.0

.. index:: deprecated


**DEPRECATED**: as decided at 2014 NIAC meeting, convert to use :ref:`NXtransformations`


**Description**:

  legacy class - recommend to use :ref:`NXtransformations` now

  It is recommended that instances of :ref:`NXgeometry` be converted to 
  use :ref:`NXtransformations`.

  This is the description for a general position of a component. 
  It is recommended to name an instance of :ref:`NXgeometry` as "geometry"
  to aid in the use of the definition in simulation codes such as McStas.
  Also, in HDF, linked items must share the same name.
  However, it might not be possible or practical in all situations.

**Symbols**:

  No symbol table

**Groups cited**:
  :ref:`NXorientation`, :ref:`NXshape`, :ref:`NXtranslation`

.. index:: NXshape (base class); used in base class, NXtranslation (base class); used in base class, NXorientation (base class); used in base class

**Structure**:

  .. index:: description (field)

  **description**: :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    Optional description/label. Probably only present if we are
    an additional reference point for components rather than the
    location of a real component.

  .. index:: component index (field)

  **component_index**: :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>`

    Position of the component along the beam path. The sample is at 0, components upstream
    have negative component_index, components downstream have positive
    component_index.

  **(shape)**: :ref:`NXshape`

    shape/size information of component

  **(translation)**: :ref:`NXtranslation`

    translation of component

  **(orientation)**: :ref:`NXorientation`

    orientation of component
