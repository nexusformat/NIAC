**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`, version 1.0

**Description**:

  (**required**) :ref:`NXdata` describes the plottable data and related dimension scales.

  .. index:: plotting

  It is mandatory  that there is at least one :ref:`NXdata` group 
  in each :ref:`NXentry` group.  
  Note that the ``variable`` and ``data`` 
  can be defined with different names.  
  The ``signal`` and ``axes`` attributes of the 
  ``data`` group define which items 
  are plottable data and which are *dimension scales*, respectively.

  :ref:`NXdata` is used to implement one of the basic motivations in NeXus,
  to provide a default plot for the data of this :ref:`NXentry`.  The actual data
  might be stored in another group and (hard) linked to the :ref:`NXdata` group.

  * Each :ref:`NXdata` group will define only one data set
    containing plottable data, dimension scales, and 
    possibly associated standard deviations.
    Other data sets may be present in the group.
  * The plottable data may be of arbitrary rank up to a maximum
    of ``NX_MAXRANK=32``.
  * The plottable data will be named as the value of 
    the group ``signal`` attribute, such as::

      data:NXdata
        @signal = "counts"
        @axes = "mr"
        @mr_indices = 0
        counts: float[100]  --> the default dependent data
        mr: float[100]  --> the default independent data

    The field named in the ``signal`` attribute **must** exist, either
    directly as a dataset or defined through a link.

  * The group ``axes`` attribute will name the
    *dimension scale* associated with the plottable data.

  If available, the standard deviations of the data are to be
  stored in a data set of the same rank and dimensions, with the name ``errors``.

  * For each data dimension, there should be a one-dimensional array
    of the same length.
  * These one-dimensional arrays are the *dimension scales* of the
    data,  *i.e*. the values of the independent variables at which the data
    is measured, such as scattering angle or energy transfer.

  .. index:: link
  .. index:: axes (attribute)

  The preferred method to associate each data dimension with
  its respective dimension scale is to specify the field name
  of each dimension scale in the group ``axes`` attribute as a string list.
  Here is an example for a 2-D data set *data* plotted 
  against *time*, and *pressure*.  (An additional *temperature* data set 
  is provided and could be selected as an alternate for the *pressure* axis.)::

    data_2d:NXdata
      @signal="data"
      @axes="time","pressure"
      @pressure_indices=1
      @temperature_indices=1
      @time_indices=0
      data: float[1000,20]
      pressure: float[20]
      temperature: float[20]
      time: float[1000]

  .. rubric:: Old methods to identify the plottable data

  There are two older methods of associating 
  each data dimension to its respective dimension scale.
  Both are now out of date and
  should not be used when writing new data files.
  However, client software should expect to see data files
  written with any of these methods.

    * One method uses the ``axes`` 
      attribute to specify the names of each *dimension scale*.

    * The oldest method uses the ``axis`` attribute on each
      *dimension scale* to identify
      with an integer the axis whose value is the number of the dimension.

**Symbols**:

  These symbols will be used below to coordinate datasets with the same shape.

  **dataRank**: rank of the ``data`` field

  **n**: length of the ``variable`` field

  **nx**: length of the ``x`` field

  **ny**: length of the ``y`` field

  **nz**: length of the ``z`` field

**Groups cited**:
  none

**Structure**:

  .. index:: signal (file attribute)

  **@signal**: :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    .. index:: plotting

    Declares which dataset is the default. 
    The value is the name of the dataset to be plotted.
    A field of this name *must* exist (either as dataset 
    or as a link to a dataset).

    It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
    rather than adding a signal attribute to the dataset.
    See http://wiki.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data
    for a summary of the discussion.

  .. index:: axes (file attribute)

  **@axes**: :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    .. index:: plotting

    String array that defines the independent data fields used in 
    the default plot for all of the dimensions of the *signal* field
    (the *signal* field is the field in this group that is named by
    the ``signal`` attribute of this group). 
    One entry is provided for every dimension in the *signal* field.

    The field(s) named as values (known as "axes") of this attribute 
    *must* exist. An axis slice is specified using a field named 
    ``AXISNAME_indices`` as described below (where the text shown here
    as ``AXISNAME`` is to be replaced by the actual field name).

    When no default axis is available for a particular dimension 
    of the plottable data, use a "." in that position.  
    Such as::

    	@I_axes="time", ".", "."

    Since there are three items in the list, the the *signal* field
    must must be a three-dimensional array (rank=3).  The first dimension
    is described by the values of a one-dimensional array named ``time``
    while the other two dimensions have no fields to be used as dimension scales.

    See examples provided on the NeXus wiki:
    http://wiki.nexusformat.org/2014_axes_and_uncertainties

    If there are no axes at all (such as with a stack of images), 
    the axes attribute can be omitted.

  .. index:: AXISNAME indices (file attribute)

  **@AXISNAME_indices**: :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    Each ``AXISNAME_indices`` attribute indicates the dependency
    relationship of the ``AXISNAME`` field (where ``AXISNAME`` 
    is the name of a field that exists in this ``NXdata`` group) 
    with one or more dimensions of the plottable data.

    Integer array that defines the indices of the *signal* field 
    (that field will be a multidimensional array)
    which need to be used in the *AXISNAME* dataset in 
    order to reference the corresponding axis value.

    The first index of an array is ``0`` (zero).

    Here, *AXISNAME* is to be replaced by the name of each 
    field described in the ``axes`` attribute.  
    An example with 2-D data, :math:`d(t,P)`, will illustrate::

      data_2d:NXdata
    	@signal="data"
    	@axes="time","pressure"
    	@time_indices=0
    	@pressure_indices=1
    	data: float[1000,20]
    	time: float[1000]
    	pressure: float[20]

    This attribute is to be provided in all situations. 
    However, if the indices attributes are missing 
    (such as for data files written before this specification), 
    file readers are encouraged to make their best efforts 
    to plot the data. 	
    Thus the implementation of the 
    ``AXISNAME_indices`` attribute is based on the model of 
    "strict writer, liberal reader".

    .. note::  Attributes potentially containing multiple values 
       (axes and _indices) are to be written as string or integer arrays, 
       to avoid string parsing in reading applications.

  .. index:: variable (field)

  **variable[n]**: :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>`

    Dimension scale defining an axis of the data.
    Client is responsible for defining the dimensions of the data.
    The name of this field may be changed to fit the circumstances.
    Standard NeXus client tools will use the attributes to determine
    how to use this field.

    .. index:: long name (field attribute)

    **@long_name**: :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Axis label

    .. index:: distribution (field attribute)

    **@distribution**: :ref:`NX_BOOLEAN <NX_BOOLEAN>`

      ``0|false``: single value, 
      ``1|true``: multiple values

    .. index:: first good (field attribute)

    **@first_good**: :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>`

      Index of first good value

    .. index:: last good (field attribute)

    **@last_good**: :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>`

      Index of last good value

    .. index:: axis (field attribute)

    **@axis**: :ref:`NX_POSINT <NX_POSINT>`

      Index (positive integer) identifying this specific set of numbers.

      N.B. The ``axis`` attribute is the old way of designating a link.  
      Do not use the ``axes`` attribute with the ``axis`` attribute.
      The ``axes`` *group* attribute is now preferred.

  .. index:: variable errors (field)

  **variable_errors[n]**: :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>`

    Errors (uncertainties) associated with axis ``variable``.
    Client is responsible for defining the dimensions of the data.
    The name of this field may be changed to fit the circumstances 
    but is matched with the *variable*
    field with ``_errors`` appended.

  .. index:: data (field)

  **data[n]**: :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>`

    .. index:: plotting

    This field contains the data values to be used as the 
    NeXus *plottable data*.
    Client is responsible for defining the dimensions of the data.
    The name of this field may be changed to fit the circumstances.
    Standard NeXus client tools will use the attributes to determine
    how to use this field.

    .. index:: signal (field attribute)

    **@signal**: :ref:`NX_POSINT <NX_POSINT>`

      .. index:: plotting

      Plottable (independent) axis, indicate index number.
      Only one field in a :ref:`NXdata` group may have the
      ``signal=1`` attribute.
      Do not use the ``signal`` attribute with the ``axis`` attribute.

    .. index:: axes (field attribute)

    **@axes**: :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Defines the names of the dimension scales
      (independent axes) for this data set
      as a colon-delimited array.
      NOTE: The ``axes`` attribute is the preferred
      method of designating a link.
      Do not use the ``axes`` attribute with the ``axis`` attribute.

    .. index:: uncertainties (field attribute)

    **@uncertainties**: :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Specify the name (or names) of the uncertainties (errors) 
      of the dependent axes as plottable data.
      NOTE: The ``uncertainties`` attribute uses the same syntax
      as the ``axes`` attribute, a string or an array of strings 
      for multiple uncertainties.

      Examples::

      	@I_uncertainties="Idev"

      	@Q_uncertainties="dQw", "dQl"


    .. index:: long name (field attribute)

    **@long_name**: :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      data label

  .. index:: errors (field)

  **errors[n]**: :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>`

    Standard deviations of data values - 
    the data array is identified by the group attribute ``signal``. 
    The ``errors`` array must have the same dimensions as ``data``.
    Client is responsible for defining the dimensions of the data.

  .. index:: scaling factor (field)

  **scaling_factor**: :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>`

    The elements in data are usually float values really. For
    efficiency reasons these are usually stored as integers
    after scaling with a scale factor. This value is the scale
    factor. It is required to get the actual physical value,
    when necessary.

  .. index:: offset (field)

  **offset**: :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>`

    An optional offset to apply to the values in data.

  .. index:: x (field)

  **x[nx]**: :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`}

    This is an array holding the values to use for the x-axis of
    data.  The units must be appropriate for the measurement.

  .. index:: y (field)

  **y[ny]**: :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`}

    This is an array holding the values to use for the y-axis of
    data.  The units must be appropriate for the measurement.

  .. index:: z (field)

  **z[nz]**: :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`}

    This is an array holding the values to use for the z-axis of
    data.  The units must be appropriate for the measurement.
