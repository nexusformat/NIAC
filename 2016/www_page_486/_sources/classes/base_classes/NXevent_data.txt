**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`, version 1.0

**Description**:

  Time-of-flight events

**Symbols**:

  No symbol table

**Groups cited**:
  none

**Structure**:

  .. index:: time of flight (field)

  **time_of_flight[i]**: :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_TIME_OF_FLIGHT <NX_TIME_OF_FLIGHT>`}

    A list of time of flight for each event as it comes in. 
    This list is for all pulses with information to attach 
    to a particular pulse located in events_per_pulse.

  .. index:: pixel number (field)

  **pixel_number[i]**: :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_DIMENSIONLESS <NX_DIMENSIONLESS>`}

    There will be extra information in the NXdetector to convert 
    pixel_number to detector_number. This list is for all pulses with 
    information to attach to a particular pulse located in events_per_pulse.

  .. index:: pulse time (field)

  **pulse_time[j]**: :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_TIME <NX_TIME>`}

    The time that each pulse started with respect to the offset

    .. index:: offset (field attribute)

    **@offset**: :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

      ISO8601

  .. index:: events per pulse (field)

  **events_per_pulse[j]**: :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_DIMENSIONLESS <NX_DIMENSIONLESS>`}

    This connects the index "i" to the index "j". 
    The jth element is the number of events in "i" 
    that occurred during the jth pulse.

  .. index:: pulse height (field)

  **pulse_height[i, k]**: :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_DIMENSIONLESS <NX_DIMENSIONLESS>`}

    If voltages from the ends of the detector are read out this 
    is where they go. This list is for all events with information 
    to attach to a particular pulse height. The information to 
    attach to a particular pulse is located in events_per_pulse.
