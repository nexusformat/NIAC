Contributed Definitions
#########################

A description of each NeXus contributed definition is given.
NXDL files in the NeXus contributed definitions include propositions from
the community for NeXus base classes or application definitions, as well
as other NXDL files for long-term archival by NeXus.  Consider the contributed
definitions as either in *incubation* or a special
case not for general use.  The :ref:`NIAC` is charged to review any new contributed 
definitions and provide feedback to the authors before ratification
and acceptance as either a base class or application definition.
    

:ref:`NXcanSAS`
    Implementation of the :index:`canSAS` standard to store reduced small-angle scattering data of any dimension.

:ref:`NXcontainer`

    definition for a quadrupole magnet.

:ref:`NXreflections`
    This is a definition for reflection data from diffraction experiments

:ref:`NXseparator`
    definition for an electrostatic separator.

:ref:`NXsnsevent`
    This is a definition for event data from Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at ORNL.

:ref:`NXsnshisto`
