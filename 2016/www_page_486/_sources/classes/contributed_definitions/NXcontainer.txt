**Description**:

  State of a container holding the sample under investigation.

  A container is any object in the beam path which absorbs the beam and 
  whose contribution to the overall attenuation/scattering needs to be 
  determined to process the experimental data. Examples of containers 
  include glass capillary tubes, vanadium cans, windows in furnaces or 
  diamonds in a Diamond Anvil Cell. The following figures show a complex
  example of a container:

  .. figure:: container/ComplexExampleContainer.png

     A hypothetical capillary furnace. The beam passes from left to right
     (blue dashes), passing through window 1, then window 2, before 
     passing through the downstream wall of the capillary. It is then 
     scattered by the sample with scattered beams passing through the 
     upstream wall of the capillary, then windows 4 and 5. As part of the
     corrections for a PDF experiment it is necessary to subtract the PDF
     of the empty container (i.e. each of the windows and the capillary).
     To calculate the PDF of the empty container it is necessary to have 
     the measured scattering data and to know the nature (e.g. density, 
     elemental composition, etc.) of the portion of the container which 
     the beam passed through.

  .. figure:: container/ComplexContainerBeampath.png

     A complete description of the shapes of the container elements with 
     their orientation relative to the beam and also information on 
     whether they are upstream or downstream of the sample is also 
     therefore important. For example, although the windows 2 and 4 have 
     the same shape, the path taken through them by the beam is very 
     different and this needs to be modelled. Furthermore, it is not 
     inconceivable that windows might move during an experiment and thus 
     the changes to the beampath would need to be accounted for.

  This class encodes the position of the container with respect to the 
  sample and allows the calculation of the beampath through the container.
  It also includes sufficient data to model beam absorption of the 
  container and a link to a dataset containing a measurement of the 
  container with nothing inside, to allow data corrections (at a specific
  beam energy/measurement time) to be made.

**Structure**:

  .. index:: name (field)

  **name**: :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    Descriptive name of container.

  .. index:: description (field)

  **description**: :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    Verbose description of container and how it fits into the wider 
    experimental set up.

  .. index:: chemical formula (field)

  **chemical_formula**: :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

    Chemical composition of the material the container is made from.
    Specified using CIF conventions. Abbreviated version of CIF 
    standard:

    * Only recognized element symbols may be used.
    * Each element symbol is followed by a 'count' number. A count of 
      '1' may be omitted.
    * A space or parenthesis must separate each cluster of (element 
      symbol + count).
    * Where a group of elements is enclosed in parentheses, the 
      multiplier for the group must follow the closing parentheses. 
      That is, all element and group multipliers are assumed to be 
      printed as subscripted numbers.
    * Unless the elements are ordered in a manner that corresponds to 
      their chemical structure, the order of the elements within any 
      group or moiety depends on whether or not carbon is present.
    * If carbon is present, the order should be:

      - C, then H, then the other elements in alphabetical order of 
        their symbol. 
      - If carbon is not present, the elements are listed purely in 
        alphabetic order of their symbol.

    * This is the *Hill* system used by Chemical Abstracts.

  .. index:: density (field)

  **density[n_comp]**: :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_MASS_DENSITY <NX_MASS_DENSITY>`}

    Density of the material the container is made from.

  .. index:: packing fraction (field)

  **packing_fraction[n_comp]**: :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`}

    Fraction of the volume of the container occupied by the material 
    forming the container.

  .. index:: relative molecular mass (field)

  **relative_molecular_mass[n_comp]**: :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_MASS <NX_MASS>`}

    Relative molecular mass of container.

  **beam**: :ref:`NXbeam`

    Details of beam incident on container, including the position 
    relative to the sample (to determine whether the container is 
    upstream or downstream of the sample).

  **shape**: :ref:`NXshape`

    Shape of the container. In combination with orientation this 
    should allow the beampath through the container to be modelled to 
    allow the adsorption to be calculated.

  **orientation**: :ref:`NXtransformations`

    The angle the container makes to the beam and how it may change 
    during the experiment.In combination with shape this should allow 
    the beampath through the container to be modelled to allow the 
    adsorption of the container to be calculated.

  **reference_measurement** --> /NXentry

    A link to a full data collection which contains the actual 
    measured data for this container within the experimental set up 
    (with no sample or inner container(s)). This data set will also 
    include the wavelength/energy, measurement time and intensity for 
    which these data are valid.
