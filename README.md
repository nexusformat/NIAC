# NIAC

This repository is mainly used as an issue tracker for code camps and NIAC meetings. 

It may also be used to work on documents for example proposals for those meetings. 
Some of the documents can be quite terse or immature. 
The material in here does not reflect the current state of NeXus.

**The reference for NeXus is the manual in the definitions repository.**

To minimise the confusing most documents will be "deleted" (but obviously stay in the repository) 
after discussion has happened and a was decision taken.
