# NIAC

This repository is for NIAC members only. 


This repository was initially used only as an issue tracker for NIAC code camps 
and meetings. 

Now it also contains NIAC internal documents. Some of the documents here are quite terse or 
inmature. Thus this **warning**: The reference for NeXus is the manual in the definitions repository. 
The material in here does not necessarily reflect the current state of NeXus.
