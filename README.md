# NIAC

This repository is mainly used as an issue tracker for code camps and NIAC meetings. 

It may also be used to work on documents (such as proposals) for those meetings. 
Some of the documents can be quite terse or immature. 
The material in here does not reflect the current state of NeXus.

**The reference for NeXus is the 
[manual](http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/user_manual.html), 
the source of which is in the 
[definitions repository](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions).**

To minimise confusion, most documents have been "deleted"
(but obviously remain in the repository) 
after discussion has happened and a decision was taken.
